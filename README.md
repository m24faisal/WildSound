# WildSound
Wild sound is an app that basically takes animal sounds, and accurately pairs them to the correct animal species. Think of it like Shazam but for wild life. 
Unlike most apps that market themselves as shazam but wild life, my app actually uses noise detection and accurately matches this to the appropriate animal species whereas the alternatives use photo detection.
This app is currently in development, so I will update this README over time.
